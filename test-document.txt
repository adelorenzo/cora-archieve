WebGPU WebLLM Test Document

This is a comprehensive test document for verifying the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system functionality.

WebGPU enables high-performance graphics and compute operations directly in web browsers. It provides modern GPU features including compute shaders, which are essential for running large language models efficiently.

WebLLM is a framework that leverages WebGPU to run language models entirely in the browser without requiring any server-side infrastructure. This enables private, secure, and fast AI interactions.

Key Features:
- Browser-based AI: All processing happens locally
- Privacy-first: No data leaves your device
- WebGPU acceleration: Leverages modern GPU capabilities
- Zero-install: Works directly in compatible browsers

Technical Details:
The system uses Apache TVM to compile models for WebGPU execution. Models are loaded as WebAssembly modules with GPU compute kernels. The architecture supports streaming responses and function calling.

This test document contains various technical terms and concepts that should be searchable through the RAG system, including WebGPU, WebLLM, TVM, browser-based AI, privacy, and GPU acceleration.
